Control of Flexible Joint Robotic Manipulator

Huge research is being carried out in relevant areas such as robotic modelling and control techniques. One of the very common functions performed by modern robots is the manipulation of objects in their environment. In general, these manipulators resemble human arms and have several degrees of freedom. In this project, we will present the sophisticated techniques that will allow us to control a flexible joint robotic manipulator. The purpose of this lab is to maintain the angle of rotation of the link at the desired position. So the report(which is attached in the materials section) will first present the system and its characteristics, its mathematical model,
then he will illustrate the control method by state feedback and then the correction with the PID corrector, and finally there will be a part for the numerical control.
We mainly used simulink and matlab for the simulation.
